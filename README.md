# Awesome Weather

Drupal 7 module that displays a block with weather info. This module uses the [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve
weather data.
The module has a settings page where the Open Weather Map api key needs to be set up. The block created by the module has a field for the
zipcode. If no zipcode is added to the block settings page, 52302 is used by default.
